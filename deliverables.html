		<h1>Team Standards</h1>
		<p>The key to effective teamwork is shared agreement on the
			expectations of teammates concerning how the team will function.
			Standards may range from assigning specific roles to each team member,
			to establishing protocols for conduct and communication, to agreeing on
			what tools (version control, word processor, etc.) the team will use.
			Team standards -- of all these kinds -- establish a common understanding
			of expectations, and facilitate efficient and effective collaboration.
			Without these norms teams have difficulty communicating and cooperating
			since each individual may have a different interpretation of how things
			should be done.

		<h1>Team Inventory</h1>
		<p>The first task for a newly-formed team is to take an inventory
			of what talents exist on the team...and what gaps there might
			be in the team's capabilities that one should think about planning
			to fill. On a more personal side, it's nice to get to know a
			little more the team members, including some hobbies or special interests.
