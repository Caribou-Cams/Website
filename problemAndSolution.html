        <h2> <br><br>The Problem: </h2>
            <p> The Earth is dying, and humans are to blame. Millions of species are facing extinction 
                thanks to humans, yet there's little that we're doing about it. One of these species is 
                Caribou, the largest, northern-ranging terrestrial animal. They are an important part of 
                our ecosystem, providing food to large carnivours as well as the indiginous species of 
                Alaksa and Northern-Canada, yet in the past two decades their numbers have fallen 
                by more than 50%. Losing such an important species would have devistating effects on the 
                environment, yet despite that scientists are trying to help caribou increase their 
                numbers, there's still very little that we know about them. <br><br>
                    
                Biologists at the Bureau of Land Management and Environment Yukon have 
                deployed video camera collars on caribou herds in remote areas of Alaska and 
                Canada in order to learn more about them. These collars take precisely geolocated, 9 second 
                long video clips every 20 minutes. This allows researchers to take a look inside the lives of 
                Arctic caribou herds and gather information such as what the caribou are eating and their 
                current calf numebrs. <br><br>

                Currently, scientists have amassed over 90,000 videos, totalling over 3 terabytes 
                of data. This data is then analyzed by volunteers for things such as important aspects of a 
                caribous day to day life, the amount of calves in a herd, and what the caribou are eating. 
                It has been estimated that the amount of time it would take for volunteers to analyze these 
                videos would be a minimum of 1 year, 41 days, and 21 hours to analyze these.

            <h2> The Solution, Phase 1: The AI</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team found that part of the problem with our client's project is that human analysis of data 
                    takes way too much time. Thus, phase one of our solution is to create an AI machine 
                    that can analyze and categorize these videos based on video quality.<br><br>

                    The specific type of AI machine that we will be creating will be a Convolutional Nueral Network, or 
                    a CNN. A Neural Network is a set of algorithms designed to simulate the human brain and how it processes 
                    things. A CNN is a type of neural network that uses a deep learning algorithm that takes in an input 
                    image, assigns an importance to various objects located in the image, and be able to differentiate one 
                    from another.

                    Our CNN will specifically be trained with videos that have been previously categorized by volunteers. 
                    The videos will be used to train the AI to recognize four different types of video quality: "Excellent", 
                    "Good/Fair", "Poor", and "Extremely Obstructed". An indepth definition for each of these can be found in 
                    our <i>Requirements Specification Document</i> located on our <a href = "deliverables.html"> deliverables 
                    page</a>. <br><br>

                    Once trained, the CNN will be able to have videos run against it so that the videos will be categorized 
                    into the above mentioned quality categorize. This solution will help our client by decreasing both the 
                    amount of videos that need to be anlayzed, as "Extremely Obstructed" videos don't yield anything visual 
                    and thus don't need to be analyzed for plants, as well as lowering the amount of categories volunteers 
                    need to analyze in each video.

            <h2> The Solution, Phase 2: The Website</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Phase 2 of the project will only be started once Phase 1 is complete, since our client's main goal is to 
                    create a working AI that can lower the amount of images needing to be categorized. </i> <br><br>

                    <img src="images/Website Flow.png" alt="Website-flow" class='Website-flow'> 

                    Phase 2 consists of creating a website that provides the volunteers with an easier way to categorize videos. 
                    A diagram of how our website will be layed out can be seen in the figure above.
                    
                    There will be two paths from the main page of the website. The first will be a training path that will allow new 
                    volunteers to go through a process that teaches them how to recognize the different aspects of videos such as the 
                    caribou’s habits, the number of calves, and the terrain type. Each time they finish a training video, the user will 
                    be shown which answers are right and wrong, and be given a score for that video. If the user’s average score for 
                    all the videos is above 80%, they will then receive an activation code that will allow them to log in to the website.<br><br>

                    An activation code or username/password will allow the volunteer to login to the rest of the website. If using an 
                    activation code, the volunteer will be able to create a username and password. Once logged in, the volunteer can then 
                    choose to either analyze videos at Stage 1, the stage where videos need to be analyzed into broader categories such 
                    as if the caribou is eating or how many calves there are, or Stage 2, the stage where videos need to be analyzed more 
                    in depth such as for what species of plant the caribou are eating. Each of these stages will take the user to another 
                    page that allows them to choose specific types of videos. For example, if the volunteer is specialized in plants in the 
                    tundra regions, they will be able to select the habitat type of “Tundra” and the activity type of “Eating” and be 
                    presented with videos that fall only into those two categories. These different categorize that can be selected will 
                    be set to “All” by default.<br><br>

                    After selecting a category, the volunteer will then be taken to a forum page containing a video forum the selected 
                    categorize they chose. This forum page will consist of the video as well as the forum, which will already have all 
                    the predetermined categorize filled in and unable to be changed. For instance, the videos name and the video quality 
                    determined by the AI will already be prefilled and locked so the user cannot change them. The forum will also consist 
                    of drop-down tabs with predetermined answers already filled in, allowing the user an easy experience analyzing the 
                    videos. When hitting submit, the data the user has entered into the forum will be saved to a backend database created 
                    by Django.<br><br>

                    Lastly, there will be a page specifically available to users who login with an admin username/password. The page will 
                    allow them to see the information in the database. The page will also allow the admins to manage users and videos. <br><br>

                    The creation of this website will help both the volunteers analyzing the videos as well as our client. This website will 
                    help the volunteers by providing an easy-to-use forum and video on the same page, with the forum already filled out with 
                    any categorize the video has already been assigned. The website will help out our client by condensing everything (providing 
                    the videos to volunteers, training the volunteers, analyzing the videos, and the data for the videos) all in one place. <br><br>

            <p> The way the two phases our project work together can be seen in the image below: <br><br>

            <br><b>Phase one</b> of our project, the AI machine, uses previously categorized videos to train itself(1). It is then provided 
            with uncategorized videos, which it analyzes and sorts into the correct categorize (2). These images are then fed into 
            <b>Phase two</b> of our project then stores these videos and their information in a secure database. Volunteers then further 
            analyze these videos for categories unable to be recognized by the AI by entering the information into the provided forum (4). 
            They submit their information, which is then stored with the video in its secure database (5). In later projects, this 
            information can then be used to further train the AI to recognize and categorize videos into more specific categories such as 
            number of calves in a heard or terrain type (6).
